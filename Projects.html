      <p>
        There was a request that we automate the sending of an Automated report for one of the gambling services that we use, and I took it upon myself to
        attempt and provide a solution while we awaited the service's team to inform us if they had an internal option. While most likely not very optimal,
        I managed to produce a solution that opens 27 different webpages one by one to: login, download the list of active users and permissions, parse the webpage, 
        copy the important user data to a CSV, and move both files to a folder. When all exports are finished, the folder is zipped, and uploaded to OneDrive.

      <p>
        For my senior capstone project, my group and I chose to create a medium-sized datacenter network
        with a focus on redundancy to ensure connectivity if a level 3 switch or a router were to go offline.
        If you hover over the photo below, you will be able to see the physical topology of our network and 
        take a better look at how we chose to build it out. We have separated each set of 3 servers into their
        own VLANs, and were successfully able to communicate between VLANs with no issues.
      </p>
      <img src="CapstoneSS.png" alt="Capstone Project Photo" class="center">
      <p>
        We are using the Cisco Hot Standby Routing Protocol(HSRP) to create a standby IP Address for each set 
        of routers to share. R1 and R2, WAN1 and WAN2, and R3 and R4 are our pairs that share an address. If 
        the primary device, actively holding the IP address, were to go offline, the secondary device will then
        pick up the standby address and act as the default gateway for all the devices sending traffic, ensuring 
        data is not lost. Please feel free to download the Packet Tracer, Routing Table, and Final Report produced
        by my group and I below!
