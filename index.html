      <p>Hello, welcome to my digital resume, prepared by myself, hosted on GitHub!<br>
        Please feel free to take a look at my experience on this site, or download my resume below!
        <br> <br>
        My name is Charles Gill Jr! I realize a headshot may be more professional, however you can find a couple photos below of myself, my family, and some milestones captured in pictures!

        <p>
        I am currently working as an IT Senior Engineer with Caesars Digital Sportsboook & Casino/Caesars Entertainment.
        I have been working full time, in and out of my field of study, since I was 17 in order to care for myself in whatever way that may be. 
        <br><br>While working full time, I have spent the last six years studying at NJIT to obtain my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology, with a specialization in Network and Information Security. 
        I am beyond happy to note that I have just graduated in May of 2023 with a 3.33 GPA and am proud to be a graduate of NJIT.<br><br>
    </p>
     <p> I strongly pride myself on my work ethic as regardless of the circumstances, I have continued to provide my full effort at both work and school.
      I believe this has prepared me for the field in a plethora of ways as it has taken many sleepless days and nights to meet deadlines and continue to
      provide above average output in all areas of my work and education. Now that I have finished school, I have reached a point where I can dedicate that
      extra effort to bettering myself for my career in new ways like obtaining new certifications or putting in extra work after hours for a high priority
      assignment. My career finally has an opportunity to be my number one priority, and I am beyond excited to embrace the opportunities that come my way.
